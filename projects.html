												<li><h3>Reading Comprehension</h3>
													<p>I have worked with reading comprehension to fit a huge use case:
														reducing employee lookup time in documentation by adapting a reading
														comprehension model - Google's QANet - to healthcare purposes so that
														answering to patient questions in real-time can be automated.</p>
													   I have improved near state-of-the-art inference accuracy by 4%
														and seek to continue to improve performance through data augmentation
														and hyperparameter tuning.
												</li>
												<li><h3>Topic Analysis</h3>
													<p>Given the abundance of patient recordings and transcriptions from surveys,
														my task was to perform topic analysis on them and generate clusters of topics.
														I designed and implemented a complete pipeline - word and sentence embeddings,
														clusterings, and projections for visualization - that generates well-defined
														clusters by topic and is reusable for future datasets.</p>
													There are aspects of deep learning with the usage of ELMo for word embeddings
														as well as traditional NLP methods such as k-Means to generate the clusters and
														t-SNE to produce 3D vectors for visualization.

													A work in hiatus, the alumni database is a SQL-based database, deployed on Flask,
														meant to contain the information of all ASES alumni and members.

													As part of the ASES Tech Team, I am responsible for maintaining the ASES website,

											<header class="style1" style="text-align: left">
												<p>ThoughtCloud <a href="https://github.com/eric-gan/ThoughtCloud" class="icon fa-github"></a></p>
											</header>
											<p>ThoughtCloud is an extension of my vision of accessible creativity.
												It is only by contemplating the nature of our existence - our world
												and society - that we will be able to perpetuate technological
												advancement. My co-developer, Eric Gan, and I hope to facilitate
												the dissemination of concepts and ideas through this platform by
												scraping together general ideas, filtered by topic, and providing
												that as a real-time refreshable feed for each user.</p>
											<p>ThoughtCloud is currently locally-run on Flask and scrapes results
												from pre-selected websites, allowing for filter by search keywords.
												We hope to expand this service in the future by dropping the use
												of a scraper altogether and implement it as more of a search engine.</p>
											<header class="style1" style="text-align: left">
												<p>uHealth <a href="https://github.com/vliu15/uhealth" class="icon fa-github"></a></p>
											</header>
											<p>uHealth is a prototype demo created by Team Ingenuity at Optum's
												Boston Hackathon. Perhaps the biggest problem in healthcare is
												efficient allocation of resources, which also includes patient
												adherence to the healthcare plan provided. uHealth hopes to solve
												this by providing easy access to an individual's data (i.e. real-time
												figures, appointments, prescriptions, history) as well as an analytics
												tab that makes predictions.</p>
											<p>uHealth is locally-run on npm and the analytics tab features a diabetic's
												prescription refills as predicted by RandomForest Regression, which is
												trained on Kaggle datasets.</p>
											<header class="style1" style="text-align: left">
												<p>Heap Allocator(s) (private)</p>
											</header>
											<p>This project includes two implementations of a heap allocator: implicit
												free list, and explicit free list. Both implement the malloc, free,
												and realloc functions in C and maintain organization of heap memory.
												Pass in a script of allocation calls (i.e. sample.script) to test.</p>
											<header class="style1" style="text-align: left">
												<p>Improved C Functions (private)</p>
											</header>
											<p>This features a handful of revised C functions (i.e. get()) that were
												rewritten because of the flawed original implementations.</p>
											<header class="style1" style="text-align: left">
												<p>Maze-Solver Search Algorithms (private)</p>
											</header>
											<p>Features a graphical user interface that allows the user to solve various
												mazes from a selection of search algorithms, including A* and Dijkstra's.</p>
											<header class="style1" style="text-align: left">
												<p>Munch <a href="files/munch-pitch-deck.pptx" class="icon fa-file-powerpoint-o"></a></p>
											</header>
											<p>Idea prototype for ASES's Bootcamp program. Munch seeks to facilitate meetups
												over a meal by matching people up by food preferences, time availability,
												common interests, etc.</p>
